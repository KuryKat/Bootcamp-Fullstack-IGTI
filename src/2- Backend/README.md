# Backend (APIs) Module
This is the "API creation module", it has more to do with backend and server creation, but it was more focused on creating APIs because it is a bootcamp 🤷😂

Okay, I change my mind, after finishing this module I learned a lot, I am very grateful for all the knowledge attributed to me, I rashly judged, it was my mistake, but what matters is that I learned a lot, thank you again!
