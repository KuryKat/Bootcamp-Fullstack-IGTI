# Basic JavaScript Module
This is the basic JavaScript module, in which the basics of JavaScript on the WEB were passed

## What's JavaScript?
JavaScript is a structured interpreted programming language, high-level script with weak dynamic typing and multiparadigm. Along with HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three main technologies on the World Wide Web.

## Example of "Hello World" in JavaScript
```js
    console.log("Hello World")
```
Only with this structure is it possible to make JavaScript write "Hello World" on the Console screen, but it needs an interpreter to execute its code, there are several technologies that do this, one of them is a framework developed more for the backend called "Node.js", but the most basic is getting JavaScript to run within the scope of a website using the HTML "script" tag!

### Example:
> HTML File
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="pt-br">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>

<body>
    <!--Here we execute the script of the file "CurrentFolder/js/index.js"-->
    <script refer src="./js/index.js"></script>
</body>

</html>
```
> "Index.js" File ``(project/src/js/index.js)``
```js
console.log("Hello World!") // => "Hello World!"
```
> Website Console (F12):
```console
> Hello World!
```

## "Why JavaScript?"
Many people ask me this, I don't know exactly how to answer it, because I've never tried other languages ​​in depth like I tried JavaScript since 2017, I've played and made some systems with C #, and I really appreciate the language, but I believe that JavaScript is still better (without wanting to offend C #, I love this language) for its incredible level of programmatic abstraction (Thanks for teaching me that term [@Takasakiii](https://github.com/Takasakiii)) that allows us to create anything we need to carry out our needs (okay, that was kind of redundant, but who said that term is always bad?)
