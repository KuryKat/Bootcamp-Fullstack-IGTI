## About me
Hello, you must already know me, I am KuryKat, an independent developer, looking for knowledge growth and looking to always learn something new every day, I am 16 years old (2020) and I am already looking for my dreams , I'm doing this Bootcamp as a small starting point for more knowledge and entry into the job market, I have been studying systems development since 2017 when I started studying JavaScript and since then I am looking to improve my tools (knowledge)

## About this
This repository was built with the intent of "documenting" my achievements and learning from Bootcamp, I have a repository for everything I learn, but I keep it private (for now, I intend to organize them and make them public)

## More Soon... <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/755117407655428127.gif?v=1">
